# Building-a-Deep-Learning-Image-Classifier-with-Keras-using-R

Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build a deep learning image classifier with keras using R that can classify apparel images such as dresses, shirts, and jackets.

**2) Which dataset has been used?**

We will be using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which has 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a grayscale 28 x 28 image classified into 10 separate categories. 

Details of this tutorial and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/building-a-deep-learning-image-classifier-with-keras-using-r/ published on Analytics Vidhya.
